# Computer Networks Projects

#### Taein Um



## Course Description
This repository contains projects and assignments from the "Computer Networks" course I completed, which provides an introduction to the basics of networking. The course covered how network applications such as the Web operate, detailed insights into the Internet, and the methods used to transmit information globally. We delved into the design patterns and general principles of designing Computer Networks, using the OSI layer abstraction from the application layer down to the physical layer.




## Projects Overview
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific project. These include:



## Learning Outcomes
Through the projects and assignments in this repository, I have demonstrated:
- Understanding of network applications and the underlying infrastructure of the Internet.
- Ability to apply OSI model concepts to analyze and solve networking problems.
- Proficiency in designing network systems based on theoretical principles and practical considerations.



## Technologies Used
- [List all technologies, programming languages, and tools used in the projects]
- Example: Python, Wireshark, TCP/IP simulation tools
